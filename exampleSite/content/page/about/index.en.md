# About Me - Áda Inneman

I am a spiritual guide, lecturer, and organizer of gatherings focused on spiritual growth, alternative medicine, and self-discovery. For many years, I have been dedicated to studying ancient traditions, natural healing methods, and the deep connection between body, mind, and soul.

## My Mission

I believe that the path to health and happiness lies in harmony with nature and self-awareness. That’s why I organize lectures, workshops, and seminars on topics such as:

- **Ayurveda** – an ancient system of healing and healthy living
- **Astromedicine** – the connection between astrology and healing
- **Spiritual development** – meditation, conscious breathing, and inner peace
- **Healers’ gatherings** – sharing knowledge and experiences

## Organized Events

Every month, I organize various lectures and gatherings across the Czech Republic, particularly in **Prague, Plzeň, and Pardubice**.

I regularly collaborate with experts in natural healing, spiritual growth, and the arts. One of the key events is the **Healers’ Gathering at Hrubá Skála Castle**, where we come together to share knowledge and inspire one another.
